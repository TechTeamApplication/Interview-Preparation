The Singleton Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is used when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The Singleton pattern is often implemented by creating a class with a method that either creates a new instance or returns an existing one if it already exists.

Key Characteristics of the Singleton Pattern:

Private constructor: The class should have a private constructor to prevent external instantiation.

Private instance variable: The class should have a private static instance variable to hold the single instance of the class.

Static method for access: The class should provide a static method to access the instance.

Real-Life Application:

One of the most common real-life applications of the Singleton pattern is managing a configuration manager in a software application:

Scenario: Imagine you are developing a complex software application that requires configuration settings to be loaded and accessed throughout the program's execution. The configuration settings can be extensive, and you want to ensure that they are read from a configuration file only once and are available globally.
