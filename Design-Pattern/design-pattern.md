According to the Gang of Four (GoF) reference book "Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software," there are 23 design patterns

These patterns can be classified into three types: creational, structural, and behavioral.

Creational Design Patterns:
Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

Structural Design Patterns:
Structural patterns deal with object composition, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures.

Behavioral Design Patterns:
Behavioral patterns deal with object collaboration, defining how objects interact and communicate with each other.

The 23 classic design patterns are:
Abstract Factory
Adapter
Bridge
Builder
Chain of Responsibility
Command
Composite
Decorator
Facade
Factory Method
Flyweight
Interpreter
Iterator
Mediator
Memento
Observer
Prototype
Proxy
Singleton
State
Strategy
Template Method
Visitor
It's worth noting that there are at least 26 design patterns discovered to date. However, the 23 design patterns mentioned above are the most well-known and widely used.

Let’s start with the Abstract Factory.
Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is used when we have two or more objects that work together forming a kit/set, and there can be multiple sets or kits that can be created by client code.Here is a real-life scenario that can help understand the Abstract Factory pattern - 

Consider a car manufacturing company that produces different models of cars. Each model has a different set of features, such as engine type, transmission, and interior design. The company can use the Abstract Factory pattern to create a factory for each model of car. Each factory will create a set of related objects, such as the engine, transmission, and interior components, that are specific to that model of car. The client code can then use the appropriate factory to create the objects needed to build a specific model of car. This approach allows the company to easily add new models of cars in the future without changing the existing code.

In summary, the Abstract Factory pattern is useful when we need to create families of related objects, and we want to decouple the client code from the concrete classes of the objects. It provides a way to create objects without specifying their concrete classes, which makes the code more flexible and easier to maintain.

—--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Adapter design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows two incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of one class into an interface expected by the clients.

 Here are the key concepts of the Adapter design pattern:
Target: The interface that the client code expects to use.
Adaptee: The existing class that needs to be adapted to work with the client code.
Adapter: The class that adapts the Adaptee to work with the Target interface.
Client: The code that uses the Target interface to interact with the Adaptee.
The Adapter design pattern is useful when we have an existing class that cannot be used directly by the client code because of incompatible interfaces. The Adapter class acts as a bridge between the client code and the Adaptee class, allowing the client code to use the Adaptee class as if it were a Target interface

Here are some of the benefits of using the Adapter design pattern:
Reusability: The Adapter design pattern allows us to reuse existing classes that cannot be used directly by the client code.
Flexibility: The Adapter design pattern makes the code more flexible by allowing different classes to work together that would otherwise be incompatible.
Maintainability: The Adapter design pattern makes the code more maintainable by encapsulating the Adaptee class and its interface.
Testability: The Adapter design pattern makes the code more testable by allowing us to test the Adapter class separately from the Adaptee class.
In summary, the Adapter design pattern is a useful tool for adapting incompatible interfaces. It provides several benefits, such as reusability, flexibility, maintainability, and testability.

There are several real-life examples of the Adapter design pattern. Here are some of them:
Card reader: A card reader acts as an adapter between a memory card and a laptop. The memory card has an incompatible interface with the laptop, but the card reader adapts the memory card to work with the laptop.
Audio player: An audio player device can play mp3 files only and wants to use an advanced audio player capable of playing vlc and mp4 files. The Adapter design pattern can be used to adapt the advanced audio player to work with the audio player device.
Employee manager: An EmployeeManager class gets employees in XML format, but the client code needs to get employees in JSON format. The Adapter design pattern can be used to adapt the EmployeeManager class to work with the client code.
In summary, the Adapter design pattern is used in various real-life scenarios to adapt incompatible interfaces. It provides several benefits, such as reusability, flexibility, maintainability, and testability.

One real-life scenario where the Adapter pattern can be used is in the integration of existing components, libraries, or systems with new codebases or interfaces. Here are some examples:
Card reader: A card reader acts as an adapter between a memory card and a laptop. The memory card has an incompatible interface with the laptop, but the card reader adapts the memory card to work with the laptop

Audio player: An audio player device can play mp3 files only and wants to use an advanced audio player capable of playing vlc and mp4 files. The Adapter pattern can be used to adapt the advanced audio player to work with the audio player device

Employee manager: An EmployeeManager class gets employees in XML format, but the client code needs to get employees in JSON format. The Adapter pattern can be used to adapt the EmployeeManager class to work with the client code

In all these scenarios, the Adapter pattern acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, making them work together without modifying their source code. The Adapter pattern enhances the flexibility and maintainability of the code by decoupling the client code from the specific implementations of the Adaptees. New adapters can be introduced or existing ones modified without affecting the client code or Adapter implementation.


______________________
The Bridge design pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently


. Here is an example of how the Bridge pattern can be used in software development:
Suppose we have a Shape class that can draw different shapes, such as circles and squares, and a Color class that can fill the shapes with different colors, such as red and blue. We can use the Bridge pattern to decouple the Shape class from the Color class, allowing them to vary independently. Here is how we can implement the Bridge pattern in this scenario:
Abstraction: Define an abstraction class that represents the Shape class. The abstraction class should have a reference to the implementation class, which represents the Color class.
Implementation: Define an implementation class that represents the Color class. The implementation class should have a method to fill the shape with a specific color.
Concrete Abstraction: Define concrete classes that extend the abstraction class and implement the draw method. The concrete classes should use the implementation class to fill the shape with a specific color.
Concrete Implementation: Define concrete classes that extend the implementation class and implement the fill method. The concrete classes should fill the shape with a specific color.
In this example, the Bridge pattern allows us to decouple the Shape class from the Color class, making them work together without modifying their source code. The Bridge pattern enhances the flexibility and maintainability of the code by separating the abstraction from its implementation. New implementations can be introduced or existing ones modified without affecting the abstraction or the client code.
In summary, the Bridge pattern is a useful tool for decoupling an abstraction from its implementation. It provides several benefits, such as flexibility, maintainability, and testability. The Bridge pattern can be used in various real-life scenarios, such as drawing shapes with different colors, working with different database servers, and extending a class in several orthogonal dimensions.

.
In all these scenarios, the Builder pattern allows us to construct complex objects step-by-step, making it easier to manage the mandatory and optional components. The Builder pattern enhances the flexibility and maintainability of the code by separating the construction logic from the object itself. New builders can be introduced or existing ones modified without affecting the client code or the object implementation.

The Chain of Responsibility design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows for a chain of objects to handle requests. Here are some real-life scenarios where the Chain of Responsibility pattern can be used:
Chain of command in a company: The Chain of Responsibility pattern can be used to model the chain of command in a company. For example, if an employee needs an approval for a task, he gives the report to his manager. If the manager can’t approve the report, for example because the costs surpass his authority, he gives the report to his manager until a manager with enough authority is found or until the report is rejected
1
.
Order processing in an e-commerce system: The Chain of Responsibility pattern can be used to process orders in an e-commerce system. For example, orders can pass through several stages, such as validation, discount application, payment, and shipping. Each stage can be handled by a different object in the chain, ensuring that the right level of support addresses the order
5
.
ATM dispense machine: The Chain of Responsibility pattern can be used to implement an ATM dispense machine. The user enters the amount to be dispensed, and the machine dispenses the amount in terms of defined currency bills, such as 50$, 20$, 10$ etc. If the user enters an amount that is not multiples of 10, it throws an error. The chain will process the request in the same order as the defined currency bills
6
.



The Command design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing clients to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations
5
. Here is how the Command pattern works:
Command: Define an interface that declares the execution method for a command.
Concrete Command: Define a concrete class that implements the Command interface and provides the execution method for a specific command.
Invoker: Define a class that invokes the command by calling its execution method.
Receiver: Define a class that performs the actual work for a command.
Client: The code that creates the command objects and sets their receivers.
In this pattern, the client creates a command object and sets its receiver. The command object is then passed to the invoker, which calls its execution method. The receiver performs the actual work for the command. The Command pattern allows for the separation of the sender of a request from the receiver of that request, making it easier to manage the requests and the objects that handle them
5
.
Here are some real-life scenarios where the Command pattern can be used:
Video editing software: The Command pattern can be used in a video editing software to implement undo/redo functionality. Each command represents an action that can be undone or redone, such as adding a clip or deleting a clip
2
.
Transactional behavior in a database: The Command pattern can be used to implement transactional behavior in a database. Each command represents a database operation, such as insert, update, or delete. The commands can be executed in a transaction, allowing for atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability
4
.
Remote control for a TV: The Command pattern can be used to implement a remote control for a TV. Each button on the remote control represents a command, such as turn on, turn off, change channel, or adjust volume. The commands can be executed by the TV, making it easier to manage the requests and the objects that handle them
1
.
The Command pattern provides several advantages, such as encapsulating requests as objects, supporting undo/redo functionality, enabling order queueing and logging, providing extensibility, and facilitating separation of concerns. However, it also has some disadvantages, such as increased complexity and performance overhead. When using the Command pattern, it is important to consider these advantages and disadvantages and choose the appropriate pattern for the specific scenario.

The Composite design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows us to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This pattern is especially useful when dealing with hierarchical structures, such as trees or part-whole hierarchies
1
2
5
.

The customer can add toppings (functionalities) as per their choice, and the pizza base (original class) will remain intact
1
.
Clothes on a human body: Clothes on a human body can be considered as a real-life example of the Decorator pattern. The human body is the original class, and the clothes are the added functionalities. The clothes can be added or removed as per the choice of the person, and the human body (original class) will remain intact
1
.

The State design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. Here is some information on the State pattern:
The State pattern is used when an object changes its behavior based on its internal state. If we have to change the behavior of an object based on its state, we can have a state variable in the object and use the if-else condition block to perform different actions based on the state.
The State pattern provides a systematic and loosely coupled way to achieve this through Context and State implementations.

The Strategy design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows the behavior of an object to be selected at runtime. It is one of the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns, which are widely used in object-oriented programming. Here is some information on the Strategy pattern:
The Strategy pattern is based on the idea of encapsulating a family of algorithms into separate classes that implement a common interface. The pattern consists of three main components: the Context, the Strategy, and the Concrete Strategy.
The Context is the class that contains the object whose behavior needs to be changed dynamically. The Strategy is the interface or abstract class that defines the common methods for all the algorithms that can be used by the Context object. The Concrete Strategy is the class that implements the Strategy interface and provides the actual implementation of the algorithm.
Here are some real-life scenarios where the Strategy pattern can be used:
Music streaming service: In a music streaming service, the Strategy pattern can be used to change the pricing model based on the subscription tier. Each subscription tier could have a different pricing strategy that encapsulates its unique pricing logic. The service's billing system would delegate the pricing calculation to the current subscription's strategy, allowing for easy modification of pricing models
